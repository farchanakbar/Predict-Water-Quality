# About Dataset

[Link to a dataset Water Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/water-quality)

## Context
This is a set of data created from imaginary data of water quality in an urban environment. I recommend using this dataset for educational purposes, for practice and to acquire the necessary knowledge.

## Content
What's inside is more than just rows and columns. You can see water ingredients listed as column names.

## Description
All attributes are numeric variables and they are listed bellow:

* aluminium - dangerous if greater than 2.8
* ammonia - dangerous if greater than 32.5
* arsenic - dangerous if greater than 0.01
* barium - dangerous if greater than 2
* cadmium - dangerous if greater than 0.005
* chloramine - dangerous if greater than 4
* chromium - dangerous if greater than 0.1
* copper - dangerous if greater than 1.3
* flouride - dangerous if greater than 1.5
* bacteria - dangerous if greater than 0
* viruses - dangerous if greater than 0
* lead - dangerous if greater than 0.015
* nitrates - dangerous if greater than 10
* nitrites - dangerous if greater than 1
* mercury - dangerous if greater than 0.002
* perchlorate - dangerous if greater than 56
* radium - dangerous if greater than 5
* selenium - dangerous if greater than 0.5
* silver - dangerous if greater than 0.1
* uranium - dangerous if greater than 0.3
* is_safe - class attribute {0 - not safe, 1 - safe}

## Inspiration
Idea was to create dataset that is good for binary classification and that gives adequate results.
